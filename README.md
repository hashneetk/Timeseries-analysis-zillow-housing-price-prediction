# zillow-housing-price-prediction
## Goal:
The goal of this project is to use the California Zillow housing dataset to do the time series analysis of the median sale prices to see if there is any trend/seasonality in the housing sale prices and to find the best model to predict the future housing sale price. 

## Dataset:
The Zillow dataset (modified) recorded Feb 2008- Dec 2015 monthly median sold price forhousing in California, Feb 2008-Dec 2016 monthly median mortgage rate, and Feb 2008-Dec2016 monthly unemployment rate. This dataset has 3 variables: MedianSoldPrice_AllHomes,MedianMortageRate,UnemploymentRate
